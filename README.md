## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Although I enjoy helping people with their financial burdens, I do have limited time to work on this. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. If you're not sure where to start, mention me in the comments!

It uses [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/) components - so check the docs before you add a component.
